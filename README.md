# Zillow Property Value Growth Analysis
The objective is to showcase neighborhoods with the fastest rising home values to provide a useful starting point for potential real estate investors to start their search. 

## Findings
Homeowners should start their search in the 75th percentile for the most rapid growth (> 64.71%). Relatively, the 50th percentile shows moderate growth (between 64.71% and 39.5%); homes with a growth rate greater than 52.16% are growing faster than the national average. Meanwhile, the 25th percentile contains homes with slower growth (less than 39.5%). Homes in these percentiles offer a second choice if  Homes with a negative growth rate (< 0%) might deter home buyers. However, these homes could be undervalued and might potentially be good investments. 

A home buyer requires further investigation to determine if the growth rate is worth the current price of the home. One should look at other factors of desirability before deciding on a home. Volatility can also be measured to assist buyers with different levels of risk tolerance. Forecasting can also help buyers anticipate times to buy or sell.

## Understanding the Data
Zillow ZHVI time-series [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SeR8qDqmhj0YHPOMiBU1zEbyaIjmAnga/view?usp=sharing) from January 2000 to May 2024 containing home values of single-family residences in 23,917 US neighborhoods across 296 months. Values are smoothed, seasonally adjusted, and calculated by taking a trimmed mean of Zillow's estimates while accounting for [repeat sales index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/repeatsales-method.asp) - [more here](https://www.zillow.com/research/methodology-neural-zhvi-32128/). 

### Data Cleaning
1. Null values

      There are 1,356,132 null values in the original dataset; that's **19.5%** (nearly 1/5) of total data. Some neighborhoods only have data for the past few months. For example, Silver Lake neighborhood in Blairstown Nownship, New Jersey only has data from December 2023 to May 2024. Filling them in with adjacent data (**pandas.bfill()**) significantly increased growth rates; doing this method caused some neighborhoods to show inaccurate growth rates like 40,000% in some. Null values were ultimately dropped. Dropping the nulls before calculating the growth rate reduces the rows from 23,917 to 21,928.

2. Dropping columns

      Dropped the following columns with unrelated data: "RegionID", "SizeRank", "Metro", and "StateName" (state initials column was kept).

### Method
Rate of change formula used:
((Current Value - Previous Value)/Previous Value) * 100

First, we calculate the 5 year rate of change for each neighborhood. Then, we plot the distribution of rates of change. Next, we take the distribution for the 50 neighborhoods with the fastest growth. Scatterplots are used to observe the distribution across percentiles.

#### All Neighborhoods

*Note: The names of the 23,917 neighborhoods do not fit underneath the x-axis. For viewability, they have been removed.

Although the spread between the minimum and maximum is wide, the distribution of growth rates is symmetrical because the mean and median are approximately close.
- Mean: 52.16%
- Median: 51.93% 
- Maximum: 211.88%
- Minimum: -44.22%

- 75th percentile: 5,482 neighborhoods with growth rates above 64.71%.
- 50th percentile: 10,964 neighborhoods with growth rates between 64.71% and 39.5%.
- 25th percentile: 5,481 neighborhoods with growth rates less than 39.5%
- Red data points: growth rate below 0%.

#### Top 50 Neighborhoods

These 50 neighborhoods have the fastest growing home values. The spread between the minimum and maximum is closer but the distribution is less symmetrical compared to the chart with all neighborhoods because mean and median are further apart.
- Mean: 152.27%
- Median: 148.70%
- The top 50 neighborhoods saw home values grow more than double in 5 years.

### Limitations
1. This study only accounts for property value growth not other desirability factors such as safety, property tax, distance to amenities, and climate.
2. Rate of growth does not measure volatility. 
3. Null values accounted for nearly 1/5 of the data set.
4. Findings rely on Zillow's value estimates only.

### Next Steps
1. Identify neighborhoods within each percentile.
2. Measure volatility.
3a. Measure the rate of change of the total rate of change (derivative) starting from the first month that the neighborhood has a value (to avoid starting from a null value).
3b. Alternatlively, one could use simple regression analysis. 
4. Find datasets with significantly less null values.
5. Consider different methods of estimating home values from other real estate companies or public agencies.
6. Zoom in on highest performing neighborhoods as well as neighborhoods with a negative growth rate.
7. Add tooltips so that each point shows more information when the cursor is hovering over it.
